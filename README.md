# Factor Graph Book Sim

This repo contains a basic python simulator for following along with CMU's [factor graph book](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kaess/pub/Dellaert17fnt.pdf).

Create a python virtual environment, source the environment, and install the necessary dependencies with this:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
